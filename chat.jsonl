Stress levels through the roof.\n  Heet: yeahhhh, Teena Sharma's Python lab is no joke. Have you started coding for the project yet?\ud83d\udc80\n  Onkar: Barely, man. Umm, I'm stuck on the chat replication part. Any progress on your end?"}
{"text": "Prince: Not really. I mean, the AI model part is tricky. Trying to figure out the training data set.\n Heet: damn, we should meet up at the library later. Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas together.\n  Onkar: Sounds like a plan. I'll bring my laptop. Let's get this thing sorted out!\n  Prince: Aight, see you guys there in an hour??\ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f\n  Heet: yeah, let's make it happen. We gotta crack this before it cracks us!\ud83d\udc80\n  Onkar: Definitely. We can't afford to leave it till the last minute.\n  Prince: For sure. Plus, I've got that dbms assignment due the day after. Talk about timing, right?\n  Heet: ughh, double trouble. I still haven't started on my presentation for the club next week.\n  Onkar: Broo, you're doing a presentation too? It's like the universe decided to throw everything at us at once.\n  Prince: Tell me about it. Can't even remember the last time I had a decent meal without rushing.\ud83e\udd20\n  Heet: the struggle is real. Sometimes I feel like we're running a marathon with no finish line in sight.\n  Onkar: But hey, once we survive this, we'll be legends. Remember that time we pulled off that hackathon project?\n  Prince: Ohh yeah, good times. We nailed it despite the chaos. This is just another bump in the road.\n  Heet: exactly. We got this, guys. Let's grind through it and celebrate with a massive feast at the end.\ud83e\udd70\n  Onkar: Lessgoo! Can't wait for that victory meal. But first, let's conquer these assignments and projects!\n \n  Heet: yo guys, anyone up for a quick study sesh at the library tonight??\n  Onkar: Yeahh, I'm down. Got that AI project looming over my head.\n  Prince: Count me in too. Need to finish this econ assignment before it drives me crazy.\n  Heet: nicee! Library at 9:00 PM. We'll smash through this work like pros.\ud83d\ude0e\n  Onkar: Aight, see you guys there. Gotta grab some snacks first, though.\n  Prince: Make it quick bro, we need all hands on deck for this grind session.\n  Heet: don't worry, I'll bring the energy drinks. Let's make tonight count!\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udfff"}
{"text": "Onkar: Lessgoo! It's go time. Catch you guys in a bit.\n Prince: Yessir! Time to crush these tasks. See you soon, fellas!\n  Heet: you know it! Library takeover, here we come!\n \n  Heet: wheree are y'all??\n  Prince: Coming, sorry for the delay, bro.\n  Onkar: Yes, almost on our way.\n  Heet: guys, be quick, don't have a lott of time in our hands.\ud83e\udd72\n  Heet: and bring laptops...\n  Onkar: Reached there.\n  Prince: Anyone up??\n \n  Heet: sorry about that, just finished up some code. what's next? \ud83d\ude05\n  Onkar: I'm diving into this dev problem. It's a doozy.\n  Prince: Trying to debug this AI model. It's throwing errors left and right. \ud83e\udd16\n  Heet: alright, I'll help with the debugging. what's the issue?\n  Onkar: My laptop froze again. Ugh, these late-night coding sessions...\n  Prince: Think we'll make it out of here before sunrise?\n  Heet: hopefully! this project's been a marathon, not a sprint. \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n  Onkar: Just need to wrap this up before Teena's deadline.\n  Prince: Counting down the hours till submission. \u231b\n  Heet: yessir! Let's push through. \ud83d\udcaa\n \n  Heet: how much did y'all complete??\ud83d\udc80\n  Onkar: Not a lot, sadly.\n  Prince: Haha same same.
